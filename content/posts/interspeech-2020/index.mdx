We recently attended the all remote [Interspeech
2020](http://www.interspeech2020.org/). Each of us made notes on what they did
overall. But instead of posting those or going with a
what-we-think-about-the-conference style post, we thought to just ask the team
what interested them the most in a few sentences. Here are the individual
responses:

[Abhinav](https://lepisma.xyz/) says

> I really liked the [ZeroSpeech](https://zerospeech.com/) challenge. As usual,
> they had few really interesting unsupervised problems and solutions. I find
> their tracks really ambitious as evident by this statement on their website
> "... infants learn to speak their native language, spontaneously, from raw
> sensory input, without supervision from text or linguists. It should be
> possible to do the same in machines".
> 
> Next year, 2021, the [target is Spoken Language
> Modeling](https://zerospeech.com/2021/news.html). Looking forward to that too.

> The Meta Learning Tutorial on day 1 was a detailed session on the topic. The
> promise of performing well on a set of task(s) with less amount of data had my
> attention. The authors take care of introduction, utility and comparison of
> this approach and its impact on tasks like speaker verification, keyword
> spotting, Emotion Recognition and my special interest conversational AI.

> A new thing here was Computational Paralinguistics, that covers the
> non-content parts of speech. Given my interest in the stylistic parts of
> speech, this was particularly interesting. Papers presented many ideas
> relevant to building a better voicebot, like - uncertainty aware methods for
> multiple labels, Autism Quotient as a perception feature, and predicting CSAT
> scores from sentiment.

> Interspeech had some great sessions, from discussions on more fundamental
> concepts related to Speech Processing in the Brain, Phonetics and Phonology to
> novel ideas on Training Strategies for ASR like Semantic Word Masking,
> Efficient Vocoder implementations for faster Neural Waveform Synthesis and
> Automatic Prosody Analysis for Non-Semantic Speech Representations. It helped
> me connect alot of dots and exposed me to some great ideas we should be
> exploring in our work.
