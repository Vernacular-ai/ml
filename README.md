This is source for the [ML team webpage](https://vernacular-ai.github.io/ml) at
Vernacular.ai. Template is [gatsby starter minimal
blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog).

## Developing

This is a [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) project. You can see the
documentation on how to work with this in gatsby's documentation pages.
Generally, for adding a new blog post, do the following:

- Make new `mdx` file in `content/posts`. See other files for example.
- Use `yarn develop` for previewing the post and writing.
- Do `yarn deploy` for deploying on github pages. You might have to clear cache
  by doing `yarn clean` so that the listing of blog posts is updated.

All this is assuming that you have the dependencies installed. Do `yarn install`
if that's not done.
