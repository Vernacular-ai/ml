We recently attended the all remote [EMNLP
2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/). Each of us made notes on what they did
overall. But instead of posting those or going with a
what-we-think-about-the-conference style post, we thought to just ask the team
what interested them the most in a few sentences. Here are the individual
responses:

[Amresh](https://ltbringer.github.io/blog) says

> I have recently been following the branch of model explainability for practical
> purposes. I was delighted to know EMNLP was experiencing a surge of similar
> research. I encountered Minumum Description Length (MDL) as a measure to
> understand a model's ability to capture linguistic properties. The core idea
> being changing the probing task of identifying labels to transmitting data.

> The Dialogue and Interactive systems track in EMNLP was very interesting and
> introduced novel techniques and approaches to some of the ML problems that I am
> currently working on for example, MAD-X: a framework for effective transfer
> learning to new languages using adapter base architecture , TOD-BERT:
> Pre-training Transformer LMs on open-source dialogue data-sets for better
> few-short learning capability this could be helpful to mitigate cold-start
> problem of SLU module. Also the generative approach based papers for dialogue
> state tracking were an interesting approach that might have few-shot learning
> capability as compared to discriminative ones.

> “Productising” ML Models has become one of the primary answers for most of the
> complex problem we face in day to day life, and explaining how they work, has
> become a bigger concern. I was happy to see a lot of papers and demos in that
> direction, like the LIT tool, which helps both the developer and the user to
> understand the underlying workings of an ML model and how it looks at each input
> and how they help in the decision making process. I was glad to see a lot of
> papers working with various NLP techniques for better and efficient Health Care
> for people, which we can all say is more important than ever, given what we have
> seen this year.

[Manas](https://github.com/janaab11) says

> The Insights from Negative Results in NLP, Workshop was a highlight for me. It
> revolved around ideas of what an interesting question is and how to connect
> ideas that didn’t work out. These questions feel central to our research efforts
> in-team, and the keynotes offered a rewarding and scientific route to exploring
> open problems in speech tech.

[Swaraj](https://github.com/swarajdalmia) says

> The papers i liked from this year’s EMNLP were : “Incremental Processing in the
> Age of Non-Incremental Encoders” by Madureira, B., & Schlangen, D (2020), which
> was similar to how humans incrementally process natural language and provided a
> way to probe the workings of transformer encoders; and “Digital Voicing of
> Silent Speech” by Gaddy, D., & Klein, D. (2020) which was presented very well
> and i felt they did a good job modelling the EMG features and got good
> improvements on silent speech. There were a lot of papers and workshops on
> interpretability of models which is essential considering the direction where
> the field is heading and the gather sessions did a good job of ensuring one
> doesn’t miss out on the social aspects of attending a conference.
